Pixel World eCommerce 
personal project by Oscar Gomez

The Pixel World eCommerce project has been developed
with main purpose of improving my hook skills and API Integration.
This eCommerce allows the user to search through 500,000+
videogames and its data by using the RAWG API. Users are able to:
- Add Item to Cart
- Remove from Cart
- Increase and decrease quantity
- Access to the checkout form
