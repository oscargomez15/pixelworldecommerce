The Pixel World eCommerce project has been developed
with main purpose of showcasing my React.js skills and along with it
I have been able to improve my understanding and implementation of
react hooks and API Integration. At the same time, I was able to improve my 
search bar design and implementation, was able to implement a custom form navigation, 
understand pagination and implementing it as well as practicing my UI & UX skills.

This eCommerce allows the user to search through 500,000+
videogames and its data by using the RAWG API. Users are able to:
- Add Item to Cart
- Remove from Cart
- Increase and decrease quantity
- Access to the checkout form
- Validate the data input on the Contact Form
- Clear Cart after checkout has been completed.
- Save cart on Local Storage meaning that a cart can be saved even if tab, or window is closed.
