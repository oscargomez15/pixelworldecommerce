The Pixel World eCommerce project has been developed
with the main purpose of showcasing my React.js skills and along with it
I have been able to improve my understanding and implementation of
React Hooks and API Integration. At the same time, I was able to improve my 
search bar design and implementation, was able to implement a custom form navigation, 
understand pagination and implement it as well, and practice my UI & UX skills.

This eCommerce allows the user to search through 500,000+
video games and their data by using the RAWG API. Users are able to:
- Add Item to Cart
- Remove from Cart
- Choose a Platform before adding to the cart.
- Limiting the user to only one platform at a time. If multiple are selected, the previous platform selection will auto-deselect.
- Increase and decrease quantity
- Access to the checkout form
- Validate the data input on the Contact Form
- Clear the Cart after checkout has been completed.
- Save cart on Local Storage meaning that a cart can be saved even if a tab or window is closed.

There are other functionalities that are in the making such as:
- Allow to place order only if all inputs are valid
- Integrate USPS Address Verify to validate the address and calculate shipping.  
- Develop a Homepage

Please be aware that incremental changes are being made and bugs might be introduced.
