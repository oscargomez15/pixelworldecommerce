The Pixel World eCommerce project has been developed
with main purpose of improving my hook skills and API Integration.
This eCommerce allows the user to search through 500,000+
videogames and its data by using the RAWG API. Users are able to:
- Add Item to Cart
- Remove from Cart
- Increase and decrease quantity
- Access to the checkout form
- Save cart on Local Storage meaning that a cart can be saved even if tab, or window is closed.
